Constant Music is a Minecraft Fabric, Forge & NeoForge mod currently developed for the latest Minecraft version.

Initially based off the Infinite Music mod, this mod removes the random timer between two ambiance music tracks in Minecraft versions greater than 1.20.

Never be stuck in silence again!
================================


Minecraft has some of the most wonderful music. Atmospheric and ambience. However, there are times when you'll find yourself in silence, with only the sounds of mobs and breaking blocks keeping you company. This mod aims to fix that. With Constant Music, you can reduce or completely eliminate the amount of delay Minecraft adds between playing background tracks. It defaults to 0 seconds, which results in the next track playing immediately. But feel free to set it higher if you desire!

## Versions for Fabric, Forge and NeoForge


The amount of time between tracks is easy to configure and can be done so in multiple locations. First, there is a slider in the "Music & Sounds Options" screen:

Second, there is a mod config screen with the same slider accessible through the mod menu. If you're using Fabric, it's only available with [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) installed:

And lastly, there is a config file created in the Minecraft folder that can edited directly if needed. The file is located within the Minecraft directory at `config/constantmusic.toml`
