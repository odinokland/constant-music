Endless Music is a Minecraft Fabric & Forge mod currently developed for the latest Minecraft version.

Initially based off the Infinite Music mod, this mod removes the random timer between two ambiance music tracks in Minecraft versions greater than 1.20.

Never be stuck in silence again!
================================


Minecraft has some of the most wonderful music. Atmospheric and ambience. However, there are times when you'll find yourself in silence, with only the sounds of mobs and breaking blocks keeping you company. This mod aims to fix that. With Endless Music, you can reduce or completely eliminate the amount of delay Minecraft adds between playing background tracks. It defaults to 0 seconds, which results in the next track playing immediately. But feel free to set it higher if you desire!

## Versions for both Fabric and Forge


The amount of time between tracks is easy to configure and can be done so in multiple locations. First, there is a slider in the "Music & Sounds Options" screen:

Second, if you're using a mod menu, there is a mod config screen with the same slider:

And lastly, there is a config file created in the minecraft folder that can edited directly if needed. The file path is `<minecraft_directory>/config/endlessmusic.toml`
